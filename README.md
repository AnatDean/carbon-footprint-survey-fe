# carbon-footprint-survey-fe

carbon-footprint-survey-fe is a SPA prototype of a multiple choice question survey.

It queries a locally running backend server [found here ](https://github.com/AnatDean/carbon-footprint-survey-be) for questions and answers.

Currently designs are only implemented for mobile view though much effort has been taken to make it moderately responsive given a small timeframe.
